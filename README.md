# Operating-System-Bytes


### Operating System
Its a system software which works as a interface between user and hardware.
Hardware - I/O Devices, CPU

### Why Operating System?
If no Operating System, the user needs to write program to access every hardware, ex - To Print a Doc, the user need to invoke the printer by writing program.

### Major Goals of Operating System
1. Convinience - Easiest Access (Windows accquired 95% market, once beacuse of convinnece)
2. Throughput - No of task executed per unit time (Linux) it gave us most efficiency.

### Functionality of Operting System
1. Resource Manger - When multiple user access, what to allocated to who is managed by Resource Manager.
2. Process Management - How to execute multiple process, (CPU Schedulling).
3. Storage Management - Harddisk (FileSystem - NFS, CIFS - How we store data in hardware, how its stored in disk architecture)
4. Memory Management - (RAM) Limitation of Size, Whenever a process executes it comes first to RAM, (Alloc & DeAlloc) occurs here. 
5. Security and Privacy - Authenticated Person can only access windows. (If any process trys to interfare other process, it gets blocked).

### Types of Operating System
1. Batch - Similar type of jobs batched - 1960 - NASA - used Punchcards to load jobs offline - They go to company - Operator - Operator Makes B1 B2 B3 - B1 will be added to CPU for execution, when CPU need to perform I/O, It goes to IDLE, then after finishin the current job, Then its goes to B2 (next job). No fix date for result. IBM made Monitor System which replaced Operators - IBSYS709X 1960 (User can directly go and execute the job)
2. Multiprogrammed - Non Preemptive - When a program is to be executed, CPU will executed it completely untill the program itself says it wants to access I/O or other operation, when the program goes to perform I/O, CPU will jump to next program execution. Less IDLENESS
3. Multitasking - Preemptive - It will be executed in a certian amount to time, if its completes well and good, if it doesn't, it will be scheduled later. So it will touch every program (Responsiveness)
4. RealTime OS - The output should be almost with minimum time difference, NO DELAYS
      * Hard - Missile System, Flight System
      * Soft - Computer Games, Youtube Live Streaming
5. Distributed - Systems are distributed (Geographically Distributed) losly copuled, If one system fails other system can executed the work.
6. Clustered - Same work as distributed, but connected thorugh LAN (kind of super computer) increased computation power. Advantages - Load Balancing, Power.
7. Embedded - It can perform only a specific task which was set once it was made. Eg - AC, Washing Machine

### Process States
Figure - New - Ready - (Wait/Block)(Suspend) - Running - Terminated --Its in iPAD photos now, make and paste it here).
1. New - Process Created not runned only stored.
2. Ready - Ready Queue, now its in Ram. Only few process can be in ready state, Long Term Schedular bring the processes in RAM (Multiprogramming) 
    * Few process dispatched to Running State (No. of dispatched depends on power of CPU). after completed - Terminated- then DeAllocate.
    * When RAM throws a priority task to CPU, then CPU will send the previous incomplete task to READY again (Priority), Time Quantum is one other factor which send the task to ready state, (Time Quantum - Specific amount of time allocated to perform the task, if its complete then terminates, if not sends back to ready and reschedule) It is done by STS (Short Term Schedular - has resonsibilty to schedule).
3. (Wait/Block) - When the is in Running state and wants to perform IO Operations then CPU will send the running program to Wait/Block state, once the operation is completed, then It will go to Ready state and then the CPU will executed once it is in Running state again.
     * When the WAIT/BLOCK queue gets filled, then the programs will be send to secondary memory (SUSPEND/WAIT), and it can do its required task there. It is done by MTS (Medium Term Schedular) when, Suspend Wait also gets filled, then extra task will go to SUSPEND READY ( which is Suspend for Ready Block - It works when the Ready Queue is filled, or a VVIP task is to be performed, the extra task are sent to SUSPEND READY), and the task which are in SUSPEND WAIT of WAIT/BLOCK are also sent to the SUSPEND READY once needed in worst cases, so that it can again go into Ready State then Running State.
     
### Linux Commands
     1. Only read condition to all - Chmod ugo = r note
     2. Chmod ugo+rw note in octal notation = 666
     3. lseek = its a system call (random acess of data, read write head) eg lseek(n,10,SEEK_CUR); --> lseek(n,5,SEEK_SET); so read write head in in 5.
     
          u r 4 ---- here ugo, means user group others, rwx means read write execute, 421 are numbers which are later used in octal representation.
          g w 2
          O x 1
     

 ### System Call 
     * To access kernal mode, eg If we are write a C prog, and want to print on screen, then we need to access kernal mode.
     (FIGURE)
     
     1. File Related --> Open(), Read(), Write(), Close(), Create file etc.
     2. Device Related --> Read, Write, Reposition, ioctl, fcnte
     3. Information --> getPid, attributes, get System time and data
     4. Process Control --> Load, Execute, abort, **Fork, nbit, Signal, Allocate etc
     5. Communication --> Pipe(), Create/Delete connections, Shinget ()
     
 ### Fork System Call
     * Used to create a child process
     * It genreally returns 0(Child), +1(Parent), -1 (Child X) X 
       eg -
          main()
          fork();
          printf("hello");
          }
          
          Output - Hello Hello. 
          
        *Explanation - 
                P -- Fork Called then C1 and P, if it is called again then P Fork Called C1, P Fork Called Again - C2,C1,C3,P.
        [Add Figure] 
        How to find  : no of output - n^2 , and no of child = n^2 -1.
        
### Understanding Fork using Program

     #include<stdio.h>
     #include<unistd.h>
     int main()
     {
          if(fork()&&forks()) {
               fork();
          printf("hello");
          return 0;
     }
     
Output : If the condition is true hello will be printed 4 times. [add figure for clarification]

Note : Child returns 0 and Parent returns +ve no;
